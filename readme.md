Our project's focus is to help reduce the chance of getting cancer by motivating people to live a healthier lifestyle.
We approached this problem by suggesting ideal times and zones for outdoor activities when/where the UV radiation and the air pollution is predicted to be the lowest in the next 24 hours.
One of the main points is the challenge system in which some public transport routes are included so if you accept one of them you can try to race against a tram or a bus in time and in distance. This way you have real life comparison for your performance.
The other motivating point is giving the freedom of choosing the type of measurement of the burned calories to the user meaning that they can choose what kind of measurement they want to use (for example apples, nutrient bars or even BigMac) with an approximated amount of calories contained in the given item and then in the app a bar will fill up when the user goes outside and starts running. This way the progression is a lot more apprehensible than just seeing a numerical value at the end of your run, thus a lot more motivating.
To reach this goal we use the following data:
- OpenWeatherMap's API for the pollution and UV radiation
- User's GPS coordinates for region
- BKK's maps for tram/bus stops and distances
